# RGB Holographic display

This is my attempt at making holographic dispaly witch adressable WS2812B-2020 LED's.

The Hardware is a remix of project made by Mislav StipiÄ‡.

I'm sure he put a lot of work into his project so I will just post my software and pcb design.
If you are interested in building this I recommend buying his project files [there](https://www.etsy.com/pl/listing/1542571614/hologram-orbiter-arduino-diy-cyfrowy?etsrc=sdt&utm_source=Copy&utm_medium=ListingManager&utm_campaign=Share&utm_term=so.lmsm&share_time=1694032537052)

The main problem seems to be the speed of WS2812B LED's. It resuleted in artefacts at the end of a rotation of the display's. 
It looks good enought but I wasn't able to resolve this issue. 
Also the website throught you change the sign is very sketchy.
It was a fun experiment but It needs a lot more work.

Design of the pcbs on which you solder the leds are [there](/PCBs)

Code you can find [there](/Code)
